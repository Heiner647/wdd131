            <h1>Welcome to Chore Wars!</h1>
            <p>
                Chore Wars is here to make doing chores fun, exciting, and rewarding! This is not just any chore tracker—this is a full-on game where you can create, assign, and complete chores while earning points for every task you finish. Whether you’re managing your own chores or competing with friends and family, you’ll always have a clear way to see your progress and achievements.            </p>
            <p>
                Start by adding chores you need to get done, then assign them to yourself or others. Each chore comes with points, and the more challenging the task, the more points you can earn. As you complete chores, your points will add up, helping you track how productive you’ve been. You can even use the points to set goals, compete with friends, or just motivate yourself to get things done faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chore Wars also helps you stay organized. With everything tracked in one place, you’ll never forget a task or lose track of who’s responsible for what. The game-like system makes even the smallest chores feel satisfying and rewarding. It’s designed to help you develop better habits, stay on top of responsibilities, and have a little fun along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                 So jump in, create your first chore, and start earning points today. Whether it’s cleaning your room, doing the dishes, or completing bigger household tasks, Chore Wars turns everyday responsibilities into an exciting challenge. The more you play, the more points you earn—and the closer you get to being a true Chore Champion!
